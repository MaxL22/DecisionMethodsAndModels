\subsubsection{Dominance relation}

Some ways to sort \textit{the stuff}.

\paragraph{Lexicographic order} Order the alternatives w.r.t. the value of the first indicator (for some ordering of the indicators) and break ties with the subsequent one. This yields a total order.

The variant with aspiration levels introduces a "minimum requirement" $\epsilon_i$, rejecting all alternatives with indicator $f_i$ worse than $\epsilon_i$ (higher or lower depending on whether it's a benefit or cost).

\paragraph{Utopia point} Identify an ideal impact with the best possible value for each indicator (optimize them independently) and evaluate all alternatives with the distance from the ideal impact. 

Different definitions of distance yield different results. Some definitions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $L_1$ Manhattan distance
	$$ d(f, f') = \sum_{l \in P} |f_l - f_l'|$$
	
	\item $L_2$ Euclidean distance
	$$ d(f, f') = \sqrt{\sum_{l \in P} \left(f_l - f_l'\right)^2} $$
	
	\item $L_\infty$ Chebyshev distance/maximum norm
	$$ d(f,f') = \max_{l \in P} |f_l - f_l'| $$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Borda count} In the case of finite alternatives, they can be sorted by counting how many alternatives are worse than each one
$$ B(f) = \left|\left\{f' \in F \mid f \wpref{} f' \right\}\right| $$

\subsection{MAUT}

\subsubsection{Indifference curves}

An \textit{indifference curve} is a subset of the impact space $I \subseteq F$ of reciprocally indifferent impacts. By definition: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The curves cover $F$
	
	\item Any two curves have empty intersection
	
	\item Weak order on impacts maps to total order on curves
\end{itemize}

Usually, continuity is assumed (they are mathematical objects and not a general set of points), and each indifference curve is expressed in the implicit form $ u(f) = c$, each $c$ identifies a curve.

%When they can be turned in explicit form
%$$ f_l = f_l (c, \dots, f_{l-1}, f_{l+1}, \dots, f_p) $$
%Then the indifference curve is a $p-1$-dimensional hypersurface in the space of indicators $\R^p$.
